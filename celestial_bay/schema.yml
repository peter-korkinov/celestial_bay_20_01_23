        It provides full functionality for the authenticated owner of the object,
        and read-only options for all other users - authenticated or not.


        Extends FlexFieldModelViewSet and is able to dynamically set fields.

        Select a subset of fields by either:
        specifying which ones should be included

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?fields=pk,name

        specifying which ones should be excluded

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?omit=pk,name

        Easily set up fields that be expanded to their fully serialized counterparts
        via query parameters (users/?expand=organization,friends)

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?expand=images

        Use dot notation to dynamically modify fields at arbitrary depths

            e.g. https://api.example.org/constellations/?expand=galaxies.images


        Uses CustomLimitOffsetPagination with default page size of 10 and maximum
        of 50.

        This pagination style mirrors the syntax used when looking up multiple
        database records. The client includes both a "limit" and an "offset" query
        parameter.

        The limit indicates the maximum number of items to return.

        The offset indicates the starting position of the query in relation to the
        complete set of unpaginated items.

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?limit=40&offset=400

        Extends FlexFieldModelViewSet and is able to dynamically set fields.

        Select a subset of fields by either:
        specifying which ones should be included

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?fields=pk,name

        specifying which ones should be excluded

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?omit=pk,name

        Easily set up fields that be expanded to their fully serialized counterparts
        via query parameters (users/?expand=organization,friends)

            e.g.  https://api.example.org/galaxies/?expand=images

        Use dot notation to dynamically modify fields at arbitrary depths

            e.g. https://api.example.org/constellations/?expand=galaxies.images


        Uses CustomLimitOffsetPagination with default page size of 10 and maximum
        of 50.

        This pagination style mirrors the syntax used when looking up multiple
        database records. The client includes both a "limit" and an "offset" query
        parameter.

        The limit indicates the maximum number of items to return.

        The offset indicates the starting position of the query in relation to the
        complete set of unpaginated items.
